# Introduction
Here are some of my notes on core Spring concepts that I've accumulated so far. It is not meant to be comprehensive but rather more of a "cheat sheet" for me to refer to when I need to refresh my memory on Spring concepts.


# Core concepts
Spring has the following main core concepts:

1. Dependency injection
2. Beans
2. Inversion of control (IoC)
3. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

# Dependency injection
>  Dependency injection is a programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally

> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)

```java
// non-dependency injection
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
    }
}

// Dependency injection
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

```
## Spring dependency injection
In short, Spring helps you to create and wire up objects in java. 

Why should I let spring do it for me?
- Reduced coupling: because the object does not create its own dependencies, it is not tightly coupled to them
- Better readability: classes solely focus on what they are supposed to do with their injected dependencies
- Better testability: Easier to mock dependencies for testing 

Spring provides 3 ways to inject dependencies into a class.
1. Constructor injection
2. Field injection
3. Setter injection

*Note: When there are 2 or more applicable beans, use `@Qualifier` annotation to deconflict or only define one bean of the same type*

**Sanity check**: If you doing `new SomeObject()` in your classes (note: not in `@Bean` declaration), you most probably not using spring and are managing the dependencies yourself.

### Constructor injection
```java
@Component
public class ExampleController {
    private ExampleDependency dependency;

    @Autowired
    public ExampleController (ExampleDependency dependency){
        this.dependency= dependency;
    }
}
```

Pros
- Enforce mandatory dependencies
- Object always have a valid dependency
- Dependency can be declared `final` to enforce immutability
- Easy to mock dependencies for testing

Cons
- Can get messy if there are many dependencies 
    - Alternatively use `@RequiredArgsConstructor`/`@AllArgsConstructor` from Lombok but take note of the usage of each annotation [here](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor)
    - Note that if you have many dependencies, it might be a sign that the class is not following single responsibility principle.

    
### Setter injection 
```java
@Component
public class ExampleController {
    private ExampleDependency dependency;

    @Autowired
    public void setDependency(ExampleDependency dependency){
        this.dependency= dependency;
    }
}
```

Pros 
- Enable optional dependencies
- Allows runtime changes of dependencies

Cons
- Initialization order is not guaranteed


    
### Field injection    
```java
@Component
public class ExampleController {

    @Autowired
    private ExampleDependency dependency;
}
```

Pros 
- Enable optional dependencies
- Short and concise

Cons
- Hard to mock dependencies for testing
- Test code is coupled with spring
- Initialization order is not guaranteed


## Best practice
1. Prefer Constructor Injection
2. Autowire fields by their interface type (if it makes sense) 

# Beans
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

In short, injected classes or classes using DI has to be a spring bean.


## Properties
Each bean has the following properties

1. Name (identifier of the bean in the application context)
    - Automatically generated if not specified
2. Scope
3. Constructor arguments: dependencies required by the bean
4. Properties
5. Autowiring mode (By name, by type)
6. Lazy-initialization mode
7. Initialization method (refer to methods marked with `@PostConstruct` in the bean, or `afterPropertiesSet()` in `InitializingBean` interface)
    - Called after the bean has been created and all dependencies are satisfied
8. Destruction method (refer to methods marked with `@PreDestroy` in the bean)
    - Called before the bean is removed from application context

### Scope
Controls when to create a new instance of a bean, and when to reuse an existing instance.

1. **Singleton (Default)**: Only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the application
2. **Prototype**: A new instance of the bean is created each time it is requested
3. **request**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request 
4. **session**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session
5. **application**: A new instance of the bean is created for each ServletContext   
6. **websocket**: A new instance of the bean is created for each WebSocket

[How to use each scope](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean-scopes)

### Autowiring modes
1. By name
2. By type
    - If 2 or more beans of the same type are present, use @Qualifier to resolve ambiguity, or else a fatal exception is thrown

```java
public interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

@Component("dogbean")
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eating");
    }
}

@Component("catbean")
public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat eating");
    }
}

@Component
public class AnimalService {

    private Dog dog;
    private Cat cat;

    @Autowired
    public AnimalService(@Qualifier("dogbean") Dog dog, @Qualifier("catbean") Cat cat) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    public void feedAnimals() {
        dog.eat();
        cat.eat();
    }
}
```

### Lazy-initialization mode
Spring creates all singleton beans at startup by default. However, you can defer the initialization of a bean until it is first requested.

This is accomplished using the `@Lazy` annotation in the following scenarios 
1. Used with class with the `@Configuration` annotation (`@Configuration` indicates class is a source of bean definitions)
    - Tells spring that all beans in the configuration class should be lazily initialized
2. Used with `@Component` or `@Bean` annotations
    - Tells spring that the bean should be lazily initialized

[See here for more details](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-lazy-annotation)

## Ways to instantiate beans

1. XML configuration / factory methods
2. Using `@Bean` annotation in a `@Configuration` class
3. Using Stereotype Annotations (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`)
4. Using `@Import` to import configuration from other classes
6. Extend `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` Interfaces
7.  `@Conditional` for Conditional Bean Creation

*Note: XML configuration is generally not recommended as it is not type safe.*

### Using @Bean annotation
```java
// Bean definition
public class TestBean {
    private String message;

    public TestBean(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public TestBean testBean() {
        return new TestBean("Hello, Spring!");
    }
}


@SpringBootApplication
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(AppConfig.class, args);
        TestBean testBean = context.getBean(TestBean.class);
        testBean.printMessage();
    }
}
```

### Using Stereotype Annotations
Spring offers some predefined annotations to help you define beans in your application. These annotations are used to indicate the role of the annotated class in the application.

1. `@Component`: Indicates that class is bean and automatically detected by spring
2. `@Service`: A specialization of `@Component` and is used to indicate that the class is a service.
3. `@Repository`: A specialization of `@Component` and is used to indicate that the class is a repository.
4. `@Controller`: A specialization of `@Component` and is used to indicate that the class is a controller.

*Note: for `@Component` and its specializations, use `@ComponentScan` to specify the package to scan for components. You don't need `@ComponentScan` if you are using `@SpringBootApplication` because it is already included by the latter annotation. *

These specializations are useful for aspect oriented programming (AOP), see [here for more details](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/classpath-scanning.html#beans-stereotype-annotations)

### Importing bean definitions
Use `@Import` when you want to import bean definitions from other configuration classes without using `@ComponentScan`

```java
@Configuration
public class ConfigA {
    @Bean
    public BeanA beanA() {
        return new BeanA(...);
    }
}

@Configuration
@Import(ConfigA.class) 
public class ConfigB {
    @Autowired 
    private ConfigA configA;

    @Bean
    public BeanB beanB() {
        return new BeanB(configA.beanA());
    }
}
```

### Extend InitializingBean and DisposableBean Interfaces

Implement `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces on your classes to define beans with initialization and destruction methods.

This is useful when you want to define initialization and destruction methods for your beans without using annotations.

But note that this is not recommended as it couples your code with spring.

```java
public class MyBean implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean  {
   @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        // Runs when bean is created and all dependencies injected
        // Run initialization logic here
    }
    @Override
    public void destroy() throws Exception {
        // Runs when application context is closed
        // Run cleanup logic here
    }
}
```

### Conditional bean creation
To conditionally create beans you will have to implement `Condition` inteface and use it with the `@Conditional` annotation on the spring bean definition.

```java
public class CustomCondition implements Condition {
    @Override
    public boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) {
        // Condition logic here
        return true;
    }
}

@Configuration
@Conditional(CustomCondition.class)  // Only create beans in configuration if condition is met
class Config {
    // ...
    @Bean
    @Conditional(IsDevEnvCondition.class)   // Only create bean if condition is met
    BeanA beanA() {
        return new BeanA();
    }
}

```

Spring boot has some built in [conditions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/condition/package-summary.html) that you can use. (Eg. `@ConditionalOnBean`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnProperty`,...)

## Best practices
1. Use Java Configuration (@Configuration) over XML configuration because its type safe and easier to refactor
2. Modularize configurations to avoid having a single configuration class with many beans


# Inversion of Control
>  Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework
>
> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)

In terms of spring, it refers to how spring takes over the management of the bean lifecycle and dependencies.

## Inversion of control container
Inversion of Control container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. It is represented by the `ApplicationContext` in spring.

For spring boot this done for us however you can still create your own `ApplicationContext` if you want to.

## Ways of instantiating IoC container
1. XML configuration
2. Java configuration

```java
// Java configuration
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
        myService.performService();
        context.close();
    }
}

// XML configuration
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
        MyService myService = context.getBean("myService", MyService.class);
        myService.performService();
        context.close();
    }
}
```

# AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
> Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.  
>
> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)

In short, AOP allows you to remove cross-cutting concerns (Eg. logging, security, transaction management) from your classes and modularize them.

This is how spring security enables features like `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize`.

## Terminology

1. **Aspect**: A modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes
2. **Join point**: A point during the execution of a program (Eg. execution of a method, handling of an exception,...)
3. **Advice**: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Timing of when the action can be taken is specified by sepcial annotations (Eg. `@Before`, `@After`,..)
4. **Pointcut**: A predicate that matches join points. Determines which advice should be run at each join point. (Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default)
5. **AOP proxy**: A wrapper object created by the AOP framework, wrapping target objects, which enables the implementation of aspect contracts 

[See official docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/introduction-defn.html)

* Note: Spring allows you to use XML or @AspectJ annotation style *

## Join point

1. Method execution
2. Method call
3. Constructor execution
4. Constructor call
5. Field access
6. Field modification
7. Exception handling


## Advice
Declare advice by using `@Aspect` annotation on a class and then using the following annotations to specify the timing of the advice

1. `@Before`: Run before the method execution
2. `@After`: Run after the method execution
3. `@AfterReturning`: Run after the method returns a value
4. `@AfterThrowing`: Run after the method throws an exception
5. `@Around`: Run before and after the method execution

*Advice parameters can be used to access the join point and the target object.*

## Pointcut designators
Spring uses AspectJ pointcut expression language by default and only supports a subset of the full AspectJ pointcut expression language.

Here are some common pointcuts used in spring
1. `execution`: for matching method execution join points
2. `@within`: for matching join points within certain types  
...

[See here for more details](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/pointcuts.html#aop-pointcuts-designators)


## Example: logging aspect

```java
@Service
public class DemoService {
	public void doSomething() {
		System.out.println("Inside DemoService - doSomething()");
	}
}

@Controller
public class DemoController {
	@Loggable
	public void doSomething() {
		System.out.println("Inside DemoController - doSomething()");
	}
}

@Service
public class DemoService {
	public void doSomething() {
		System.out.println("Inside DemoService - doSomething()");
	}
}

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
public @interface Loggable {
}

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
	@Pointcut("@annotation(com.aop.example.demo.aop.aspect.Loggable)") // Named pointcuts
	public void loggableMethods() {
	}

	@Pointcut("@within(com.aop.example.demo.aop.aspect.Loggable)") // Named pointcuts
	public void loggableClassMethods() {

	}

	@Pointcut("@within(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)") // Named pointcuts
	public void serviceBeans() {
	}

	@Before("loggableClassMethods() || loggableMethods() ||serviceBeans()")
	public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
		String methodName = joinPoint.getSignature().getName();
		String className = joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringType().getSimpleName();
		System.out.println("Before " + className + " - " + methodName + "()");
	}

	// Short hand
	@After("execution(* com.aop.example.demo.aop.controllers..*(..)) "
			+ "|| execution(* com.aop.example.demo.aop.services..*(..)) "
			+ "|| execution(* com.aop.example.demo.aop.repositories..*(..))")
	public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
		String methodName = joinPoint.getSignature().getName();
		String className = joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringType().getSimpleName();
		System.out.println("After " + className + " - " + methodName + "()");
	}
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoAopApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoAopApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public ApplicationRunner appRunner(
        DemoController demoController, 
        DemoService demoService, 
        DemoRepository demoRepository) {
		return args -> {
			demoController.doSomething();
			demoService.doSomething();
			demoRepository.doSomething();
		};
	}
}

```

Resulting output
```
Before DemoController - doSomething()
Inside DemoController - doSomething()
After DemoController - doSomething()
Before DemoService - doSomething()
Inside DemoService - doSomething()
After DemoService - doSomething()
Before DemoRepository - doSomething()
Inside DemoRepository - doSomething()
After DemoRepository - doSomething()
```

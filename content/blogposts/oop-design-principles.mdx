# Introduction
Here is a summary of common OOP design principles and best practices in Java. 

# SOLID principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should only have a single responsibility/purpose.

> "A class should have only one reason to change"\
> "Gather together the things that change for the same reasons"\
> \
> Robert C. Martin

## Open/Closed Principle
A module should be extendable without requiring modification. Adding new features should only require adding new code.

> "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"\
> \
> Bertrand Meyer

Common applicable situations 
- Use **interfaces** to define the contract of a class so that new implementations be added (eg. PaymentMethods and its implementations)
- Use **strategy pattern** for operations that may have varying implementations
- Use **adapter pattern** to adapt to new requirements
- Use **visitor pattern** to add new operations to existing classes without modifying them

## Liskov Substitution Principle
A subclass should not be more restrictive than the behaviour specified by the superclass. 

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\
> \
> Robert C. Martin

> Rules
> 1. Method signature rules
>    - **Argument**: Overridden subtype method argument types can be identical or wider than the supertype method argument types
>    - **Return type**: overridden subtype method can be narrower than the return type of the supertype method
>    - **Exceptions**: subtype method can throw fewer or narrower (but not any additional or broader) exceptions than the supertype method.
> 2. Properties Rule 
>    - **Class Invariants**: all subtype methods (inherited and new) must maintain or strengthen the supertype’s class invariants.
>    - **History Constraint**: subclass methods (inherited or new) shouldn’t allow state changes that the base class didn’t allow.
> 3. Methods Rule
>    - **Preconditions**: A subtype can weaken (but not strengthen) the precondition for a method it overrides
>    - **Postconditions**: A subtype can strengthen (but not weaken) the postcondition for a method it overrides
>

```java
// Does not satisfy LSP
interface Bird {
    public void fly();
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}

// LSP
interface Bird {
    public void eat();
}

interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
    public void fly();
}

class Penguin extends FlyingBird {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // eat
    }
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}
```
Common applicable situations 
- When designing class hierarchies
- Overriding methods
- Implementing interfaces
- Refactoring/extending existing code

## Interface Segregation Principle
The interface should be specific rather than general-purpose. 

Prevents "fat" interfaces.

> "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use"
> \
> Robert C. Martin

```java
// Violates ISP
interface MultiFunctionDevice {
    void print(Document d);
    void scan(Document d);
}

class SimplePrinter implements MultiFunctionDevice {
    @Override
    public void print(Document d) {
        System.out.println("Printing document.");
    }

    @Override
    public void scan(Document d) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Scan function is not supported.");
    }
}
// ISP
interface Printer {
     void print(Document d);
}

interface Scanner {
    void scan(Document d);
}

class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
    @Override
    public void print(Document d) {
        System.out.println("Printing document.");
    }
}

class PhotoCopier implements Printer, Scanner {
    @Override
    public void print(Document d) {
        System.out.println("Printing document.");
    }
    @Override
    public void scan(Document d) {
        System.out.println("Scanning document.");
    }
}
```


## Dependency Inversion Principle
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

```java
// DIP 
// 1. ReportGenerator and DatabaseDataSource dependend on abstraction DataSource
// 2. DataSource does not depend on fetchData() details
interface DataSource {
    Data fetchData();
}

class DatabaseDataSource implements DataSource {
    public Data fetchData() {
        // Implementation details for fetching data from a database
    }
}

class ReportGenerator {
    private DataSource dataSource;

    public ReportGenerator(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
    }

    public void generateReport() {
        Data data = dataSource.fetchData();
        // Use the data to generate the report
    }
}
```
# DRY
Dont repeat yourself

Reduce repetition by replacing it with abstractions

Common methods
- Extracting repeated lines into methods
- Using constants for repeated values
- Abstracting Common Functionality with Interfaces or Abstract Classes

# KISS 
Keep it simple

1. Simple and descriptive naming
2. Short and focused functions with a single purpose
3. Avoid premature optimizations
4. Use simple solutions that work before using complex ones

# Immutability
Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be changed after construction.
- Thread safe
- Simple
- Can be cached and reused
- Makes good hash keys
- Fit well with functional programming (where transformations result in new objects)

Mutable objects are objects that can be modified after creation.
- Better performance (no need to create new objects)
- Class represents an object that has a changing state
- Better for complex states

Best practice
- Default to Immutability
- Minimize mutability
- Document mutability

# Law of Demeter
Objects should avoid accessing the internal data and methods of other objects

> 1. Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
> 2. Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
> 3. Only talk to your immediate friends.

Benefits
- Reduces coupling

```java
// Violates LoD
book.getPage().getText().print();
// LoD
book.printPageText();
```
